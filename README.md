# Analysis of riding-sharing data by city type


## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the follow factors
(total number rides, total number of drivers and total fares) correlation with each each three city area (Rrural, suburban, urban).
By summarrizing the total driver, total amount of fares, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type (Rural,Suburban,Urban), and also by plotting the graph to become data visualization, we can gain some insights into the ride sharing industry. It is suprising to learn that the rural areas have higher fares per rides compared with other areas.


## Results
     
* **Urban**:
Urban has the most total rides, total drivers and the most total fares. The average fare per ride is the least expensive ($24.53) compared to the other cities. The average fare per driver is the least among three areas at $16.57 per ride.
* **Rural**:
Rural has the least total rides, total drivers and the total fares. The most expensive per ride is $34.62 in rural areas and the average fare per driver is the most at $55.49 per ride.
* **Suburban**:
Compared with rural and urban areas, all the metrix are in the middle. 

The result is present in figure 1.

* Urban rides has the most total fares amount between Jan,1 2019 to April,29 2019. Rural rides has the least total fare amount. This is intuitive result, based on the summary of DateFrame, urban has the most total rides, total drivers and total fares, and rural the least result of these three metrix.  
    
    
## Summary
* According to the dataframe and the trend of the line chart, the urban cities generate the most revenue for the ride-sharing company. The company should continue the same strategy to bring the most profit. 
* The rural cities generate the least revenue for the company. However, the average of fare per ride is the highest for rural type. If the company can spend more effort to grow the business in the rural areas to see if it is possible to increase the ridership, it should then be able to increase the revenue for rural cities as well.
* It should collect more data points to observe at least one year of data trend before making future major decisions. There are a few periods of time for each city type where fare revenue is higher than other time periods. We can research more on the reason why these time periods bring higher ridership demand. If the reasons are found to be repeatable for each year, they can make the proposal to hire more part-time drivers to meet the temporary high demand. It can bring more revenue on these special occasions.
