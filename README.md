# Analysis of riding-sharing data by city type


## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the follow factors
(total number rides, total number of drivers and total fares) correlation with each each three city area (Rrural, suburban, urban).
By summarrizing the total driver, total amount of fares, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type (Rural,Suburban,Urban), and also by plotting the graph to become data visualization, we can gain some insights into the ride sharing industry. It is suprising to learn that the rural areas have higher fares per rides compared with other areas.


## Results
     
* **Urban**:
Urban has the most total rides, total drivers and the most total fares. The average fare per ride is the least expensive ($24.53) compared to the other cities. The average fare per driver is the least among three areas at $16.57 per ride.

## Summary
* According the Datframe and the trend of line chart. The Urban cities generate the most revenue for the company. The company should be continue the same strategy to bring the most profit for the company. 
* According the datframe and the trend of line chart. The rural cities generate the least revunefor the company. However, the average of fare per ride is the highest for rural type. If company can follow the most profit city type_urban city type data, can focous on researching between ridership and amount of drivers, to see if possible to increase the ridership, should be able to increase the revenue for rural type cities.
* It should collect more data point at least observe a year's data trend before making further major decision. There are few period of timeframe on each city type, higher fare revenue than other months.We can research more behind reason which bring higher ridership demand on these timeperiods.If the cause reasons are repeable for each year, can make the proposal to hire partime driver to meet the tempary high demand ridership. It can bring more revenue on special occactions.
